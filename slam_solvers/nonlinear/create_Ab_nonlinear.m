% CREATE_AB_NONLINEAR
% 16-831 Fall 2016 - *Stub* Provided
% Computes the A and b matrices for the 2D nonlinear SLAM problem
%
% Arguments: 
%     x       - Current estimate of the state vector
%     odom    - Matrix that contains the odometry measurements
%               between consecutive poses. Each row corresponds to
%               a measurement. 
%                 odom(:,1) - x-value of odometry measurement
%                 odom(:,2) - y-value of odometry measurement
%     obs     - Matrix that contains the landmark measurements and
%               relevant information. Each row corresponds to a
%               measurement.
%                 obs(:,1) - idx of pose at which measurement was 
%                   made
%                 obs(:,2) - idx of landmark being observed
%                 obs(:,3) - x-value of landmark measurement
%                 obs(:,4) - y-value of landmark measurement
%     sigma_o - Covariance matrix corresponding to the odometry
%               measurements
%     sigma_l - Covariance matrix corresponding to the landmark
%               measurements
% Returns:
%     A       - MxN matrix
%     b       - Mx1 vector
