% 16-831 Fall 2016 - *Stub* Provided
% Solves linear system using first Cholesky method
%
% Arguments: 
%     A     - A matrix from linear system that you generate yourself
%     b     - b vector from linear system that you generate yourself
%
% Returns:
%     x     - solution to the linear system, computed using the specified
%             version of the Cholesky decomposition
%     R     - R factor from the Cholesky decomposition
%
