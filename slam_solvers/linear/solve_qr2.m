% Solves linear system using second QR method
%
% Arguments: 
%     A     - A matrix from linear system that you generate yourself
%     b     - b vector from linear system that you generate yourself
%
% Returns:
%     x     - solution to the linear system, computed using the specified
%             version of the QR decomposition
%     R     - R factor from the QR decomposition
%
function [x, R] = solve_qr2(A, b)
